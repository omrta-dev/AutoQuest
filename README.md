# AutoQuest
AutoQuest is just a hobbyists journey to creating a C++ Vulkan rendering engine. The goal of this engine is to eventually run everywhere (Linux, Windows, OSX, Android, and IOS for now)

## Current Status
We can clear the screen to a specific color!

## Third-Party libraries used
Thanks to the following libraries for making this possible!
- SDL2 (OS level handling for contexts, events, and input)
- Vulkan (Rendering framework)
- Assimp (Model Loading)
- GLM (Math library for 3D concepts)
