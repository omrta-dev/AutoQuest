# AutoQuest
[![Documentation](https://codedocs.xyz/omrta-dev/AutoQuest.svg)](https://codedocs.xyz/omrta-dev/AutoQuest/)

AutoQuest is just a hobbyists journey to creating a C++ OpenGL rendering engine. The goal of this engine is to eventually run on Android, Windows, and Linux 

_Currently tested in Windows and Linux, Android support should ideally work in a native C++ application as I've tested SFML there, as long as the code is OpenGL 4.3 or lower it should be cross compatible with OpenGL ES 3.2_
